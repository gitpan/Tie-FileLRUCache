Tie::FileLRUCache

 Provides a lightweight Least Recently Used cache of data via
 either an object or tied interface. Keys and data are both
 allowed to be references and objects as well as scalars.

Changes:

    1.02 2005.09.08 - Added build tests. Major code cleanup. Improved platform portability.
                      Added and documented 'cache_dir', 'keep_last' and 'number_of_entries'
                      methods. Added Module::Build support.



    1.01 1999.12.09 - Added detainting in internal cache maintaining
                    functions to evade Taint's tainting
                    of filenames read via readdir().

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed, you can use:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install
