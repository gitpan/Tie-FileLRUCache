Tie::FileLRUCache

 Provides a lightweight Least Recently Used cache of data via 
 either an object or tied interface. Keys and data are both 
 allowed to be references and objects as well as scalars. Requires 
 'Digest::SHA1' to be installed.

Changes:
    1.01 19991209 - Added detainting in internal cache maintaining 
                    functions to evade Taint's overzealous tainting 
                    of filenames read via readdir().

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
